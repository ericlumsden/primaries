        <p>The graphs below are meant to accompany my <a href="https://ericlumsden.github.io/blog/blog.html">blog post</a> about building an interactive web graphic by investigating the correlation
            between a sitting president's approval rating and the number of individuals competing for the opposing party's nomination. <br>
            Click on the data points to get a readout of the year, sitting President, their approval ratings and a list of the individuals running for the opposing party's nomination.<br>
            Green dots indicate a sitting President whose party won the election; red indicates a loss for the sitting President's party.<br>
            Grey is for our current President.
